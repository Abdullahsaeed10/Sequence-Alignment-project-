# Project Statment

- You are requested to generate GUI for software that can do the following functions:  
  
1. Global pairwise alignment  
2. Local pairwise alignment  
3. Multiple Sequence Alignment  
  
- Your GUI should take input sequence from the user through fasta file or text input. Then it should validate the inputs and execute the required alignment. Finally, it should represent the alignment itself along with the alignment score. You should create unique representations (plots) for your alignment result.  
  
- Using your GUI software, you need to analyze and interpret the output of a set of sequences based on your group number.
- Asses the produced MSA using three metrics; sum of pairs could be one of them.
